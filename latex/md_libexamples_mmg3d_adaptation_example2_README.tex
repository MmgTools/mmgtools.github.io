We read the mesh and solution in files.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item First we remesh in debug mode\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item we ask for a minimal size of 0.\+001, a maximal size of 40, a gradation of 2 and a global hausdorff value (applied on all the boundaries) of 0.\+1;
\item we save the mesh and solution.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Second, we remesh in normal mode, with specified memory and lower verbosity\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item in addition to previous parameters, we ask that all boundary triangles of ref 36 respect a hasdorff number of 0.\+01 and all boundary triangles of ref 38 a hasdorff number of 1. For both reference, we set the minimal (resp. maximal) edge size to 0.\+00001 (resp. 40). ~\newline
 The local hausdorff number on ref 38 has no effects because it is higher than the previous value (without local value, we apply global hausdorff (0.\+1)) and this value is now contained in the metric;
\item we don\textquotesingle{}t save results but we reset the computed metric and reapply the initial constant metric of size 10;
\item we perform the last wave of refinment. Now we can see the effect of the local hausdorff number on ref 38;
\item we save the mesh and solution

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Build and install the {\bfseries{mmg3d}} shared and static library. We suppose in the following that you have installed the {\bfseries{mmg3d}} library in the $\ast$$\ast$\+\_\+\$\+CMAKE\+\_\+\+INSTALL\+\_\+\+PREFIX\+\_\+$\ast$$\ast$ directory (see the \href{https://github.com/MmgTools/Mmg/wiki/Setup-guide\#iii-installation}{\texttt{ installation}} section of the setup guide);
\item compile the main.\+c file specifying\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the {\bfseries{mmg3d}} include directory with the {\bfseries{-\/I}} option;
\item the {\bfseries{mmg3d}} library location with the {\bfseries{-\/L}} option;
\item the {\bfseries{mmg3d}} library name with the {\bfseries{-\/l}} option;
\item for the static library you must also link the executable with, if used for the {\bfseries{mmg3d}} library compilation, the scotch and scotcherr libraries and with the math library;
\item with the shared library, you must add the $\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\+\_\+\$\+CMAKE\+\_\+\+INSTALL\+\_\+\+PREFIX\+\_\+$\ast$$\ast$ directory to your {\bfseries{LD\+\_\+\+LIBRARY\+\_\+\+PATH}}.
