\#\+Example to move from mmg3d4 library to mmg3d5 library


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the $\ast$$\ast$\+\_\+main.cold\+\_\+$\ast$$\ast$ correspond to a mmg3d4 library call;
\item the $\ast$$\ast$\+\_\+main.c\+\_\+$\ast$$\ast$ is the same code but with a call to the new mmg3d library (5.\+x.\+x release).
\end{DoxyItemize}

It is strongly advised to use the mmg3d5 API functions instead of hard setting your mesh as it was required by the mmg3d4 library.

{\bfseries{Remarks\+:}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item You will find the same example (with additionnal boundary triangles) in the $\ast$$\ast$\+\_\+example0\+\_\+$\ast$$\ast$ directory;
\item please, refer to the $\ast$$\ast$\+\_\+example0\+\_\+$\ast$$\ast$ directory to have an example of \+\_\+\char`\"{}clean\char`\"{}\+\_\+ call of the new {\bfseries{mmg3d}} library and to see how to build the example executable.
